**About:**

The intention timer is an application that allows a user to set goals for their health and productivity, tied to an amount of time. 
Users will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. 
The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time.

In order to use this app, simply create a new activity by selecting a category (study, exercise, or meditate), giving 
it a title (ex. 'Study HTML'), and then adding time by using the up/down arrows for the number of minutes and seconds you 
wish to commit to this awesome thing you're going to be doing. When you click "Start Activity", you'll see a timer waiting 
for you to click Start and when you do, it will count down. You'll know when it's done because it will then say "COMPLETE!"

You can then choose to Log your activity, which will place a small reminder of your accomplishment over on the right side 
of your browser; you'll then need to click Create New Activity if you want to do something new. 
Alternatively, you can go straight to a new activity by choosing Create New Activity (for example, if you don't 
particularly want to save the one you just completed).

Feel free to close the window or refresh -- your completed activities will still be there! 

Enjoy!
